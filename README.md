This is a static webpage that just consists of a 10 question quiz. The user will be able to write the answer to each question in each input box. Then, once they are done with their attempt of the quiz, they'll click on the submit button that'll be near the bottom of the page to see which questions they got right or wrong, and they'll see their score near the bottom of the page aswell.
